### Running automated tests

In this **"how to"** we will explain you how to run a new or existing automated test cases suite on our device farm in the cloud. For this tutorial, we have created a very simple demo project that test a native Android app with some automated functional tests created in **Appium** and **TestNG**.

To understand how to run your suite on [Mobilebox](http://mobileboxlab.com), we recommend following this [tutorial](http://documentation.mobileboxlab.com) using the demo app, and then replicating the same steps on your existing test suite.
